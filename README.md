# Mesh-Slicer

This projects main features are the Mesh Slicer, Intersection Shader and the Blend Tree for the characters animations during the slice mode.
I explain how all these features work on my portfolio.

Tips:

- If you want an object to be unsliceable then put them in the "Unsliceable" layer.
- Slicer.cs has an event onSlice that triggers when Slicer.Slice() is used.
