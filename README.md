# Mesh-Slicer

Hello there and welcome.

This project breaks down a cool feature used in Metal Gear Solid Reveangance where a player can freely split a 3D mesh into two mesh halves by controlling a plane that intersects the target meshes.
In order to make this mechanic to be properly realized I also added a character wielding a sword with animations (blend-tree) and implemented a custom intersection shader for the intersecting plane.

I cover these three main features in depth on my [portfolio](https://perryivic.wixsite.com/portfolio/mesh-slicer):

- [Blend Tree (Character animations)](https://perryivic.wixsite.com/portfolio/blend-tree-section)
